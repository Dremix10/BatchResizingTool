# Batch Resizing Tool
 
## Creating an environment

I used Python 3.10.5 and some packages that can be installed using the following command:

```.bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To use the script run the following command:

```.bash
python resize_sample.py
```

You have to input the directory of the pictures to be resized and also the interval at which the sample should be taken

For example, if you input `4` then for every 4 pictures in the folder one will be resized and added to the sample folder created
